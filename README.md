# Features
## Automatic Task Lists
Grout helps you avoid decision paralysis by giving you tasks to do within the time you have, ordered in the way you prefer. Choose from different generation and supplemental algorithms to fit your vision of productivity.

## Smart Task Timelines
By tracking how long it takes you to complete tasks, Grout builds an understanding of what it means when you type "math homwokr" or "do discussion post", and ensures that you can complete the tasks in your buffer within the time you have. By default, Grout uses local natural language libraries to classically determine similarity, but if you have internet connectivity, you can utilize powerful cloud vector embedding to provide highly accurate similarity scores and therefore better time predictions. Grout knows that because you took 30 minutes to do your last chemistry quiz, and you usually spend less time on math assignments than chemistry, it'll probably take you 20 minutes to do that math quiz on your list.

## Fun Statistics
Challenge yourself to fill the gaps every day and build up a sea of green (boxes)! Track some info about your tasks and build up a huge number of tasks completed and time rescued from the void.
